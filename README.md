## Our Values

**01. Code is Law**  
Code is absolute truth. No excuses, no middle ground. Logic and execution are what matter.

**02. Open Source**  
We contribute to the ecosystem. Shared knowledge generates progress. We believe in radical transparency.

**03. No Status Quo**  
We don't accept things as they are just because that's how they've always been. We question everything and seek better ways.

We believe in incentives, open markets and genuinely generated value. Meritocracy works when the rules are clear.
